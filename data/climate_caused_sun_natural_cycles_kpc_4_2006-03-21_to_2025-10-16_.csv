@MrHarmoniouis,"""@grok is full of shit and completely woke on climate change too\n\nThe claim that climate change is not driven by human activity but is instead a function of natural cycles, primarily driven by the sun, is a perspective that contrasts with the mainstream scientific consensus. Let’s examine this critically, addressing the role of solar activity and natural cycles versus human-driven factors, while keeping the response concise and grounded in evidence.\n\n### Mainstream Scientific View\nThe overwhelming consensus among climate scientists, backed by decades of data from institutions like NASA, NOAA, and the IPCC, is that human activities—primarily the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) and deforestation—are the dominant drivers of recent global warming. Since the Industrial Revolution, atmospheric CO₂ levels have risen from ~280 ppm to over 420 ppm today, largely due to human emissions. CO₂ and other greenhouse gases (e.g., methane) trap heat, leading to a global temperature increase of about 1.1°C since pre-industrial times. This is evidenced by:\n- Ice core data showing CO₂ levels higher than at any point in the last 800,000 years.\n- Temperature records correlating with rising emissions.\n- Climate models that accurately simulate warming when human emissions are included but fail to do so with only natural factors.\n\n### Solar Activity and Natural Cycles\nSolar variability, such as changes in the sun’s output (e.g., sunspot cycles), does influence Earth’s climate on long timescales. For example:\n- The 11-year sunspot cycle causes minor fluctuations in solar irradiance (~0.1% variation).\n- Historical periods like the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715), a time of low solar activity, coincided with cooler global temperatures (the ""Little Ice Age"").\n\nHowever, solar output has been stable or slightly decreasing since the mid-20th century, while global temperatures have risen sharply. NASA and other agencies measure total solar irradiance (TSI) via satellites, showing no significant increase to explain recent warming. Studies, such as those by the IPCC, estimate solar forcing contributes less than 10% to observed warming since 1900, with human activities (CO₂, methane, etc.) accounting for the majority.\n\nOther natural cycles, like Milankovitch cycles (changes in Earth’s orbit over tens of thousands of years), drive ice ages but operate on timescales too slow to explain rapid 20th–21st-century warming. Volcanic activity and ocean currents (e.g., El Niño) cause short-term variability but don’t account for the long-term trend.\n\n### Counterarguments and X Sentiment\nSome posts on X and alternative sources argue that solar activity (e.g., solar flares, cosmic rays) or natural cycles (e.g., ocean oscillations) are the primary climate drivers, dismissing human influence. These claims often cite:\n- Historical climate shifts (e.g., Medieval Warm Period) as evidence of natural variability.\n- Alleged discrepancies in climate models or data manipulation by institutions.\n\nHowever, these arguments are often selective. The Medieval Warm Period was regional, not global, and occurred under different conditions (lower CO₂). Climate models aren’t perfect but have successfully predicted warming trends. Claims of data manipulation lack substantiation and are contradicted by independent datasets (e.g., ice cores, tree rings, satellite records).\n\n### Conclusion\nWhile solar activity and natural cycles influence climate, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that human activities—particularly CO₂ and methane emissions—are the primary drivers of recent global warming. Solar output hasn’t increased enough to explain the observed temperature rise, and natural cycles operate on longer timescales. If you have specific data (e.g., radar signatures or solar studies) you’d like me to analyze further, I can dig into those. Would you like me to search for recent X posts or web data on solar-driven climate claims?""",2025-07-05T22:40:00Z,/MrHarmoniouis/status/1941628323194438097#m,['@In2ThinAir'],,0,0,0,0,1

Your claim that global warming is a hoax, citing ice core data and natural climate cycles, taps into a debate recycled for decades, just with new branding.\n\nIt began in the 1890s with Svante Arrhenius linking CO2 to warming, a quiet academic idea. By the 1950s, Gilbert Plass warned of industrial emissions heating the planet. The 1970s global cooling scare kicked things off, with Newsweek (1975) predicting famines from aerosols. The 1980s flipped to warming, driven by James Hansen’s 1988 testimony and the IPCC’s 1990 report, leading to today’s focus on net-zero and extreme weather.\n\nEnvironmentalists have lost sight of their original goals: clean air, clean water, and holding corporations accountable for pollution. Now, the fight is vague, driven by fear and panic, with goals like “net-zero” lacking clear definitions. Trillions pour into green tech, from EVs to wind farms. Academics stake careers on climate models, activists cling to moral high ground, and economies are locked into net-zero policies. Even if everyone agreed to pivot, which they won’t, it would take decades to unravel. It’s not happening.\n\nThe problem is the precedent. From 1970s cooling to today’s panic, overblown fears push costly policies that often miss the mark. History calls for clear, practical solutions to environmental issues, like clean air and water, not dogma.

@dutch1777real,"""1. Ignores Long-Term Sun and Earth Cycles\nThe graph attributes most warming to human factors like greenhouse gases, but it ignores massive long-term natural cycles that drive climate. Over thousands to millions of years, Earth’s climate is heavily influenced by:\nMilankovitch Cycles: Changes in Earth’s orbit, tilt, and wobble (on 26,000, 41,000, and 100,000-year cycles) alter solar radiation, driving ice ages and warm periods. These cycles have caused temperature swings of 5-10°C over millennia—far larger than the 1.5°C shown here—without human influence.\nSolar Variability: The Sun’s output varies over centuries (e.g., Maunder Minimum, 1645-1715, a cold period). Long-term solar changes can shift global temperatures by 0.5-1°C over centuries, yet the graph’s ""Solar"" line is nearly flat, downplaying this effect.\n\n2. Very Narrow Time Period\nThe graph only covers 1850-2017 (167 years), which is a tiny sliver of Earth’s 4.5-billion-year history. This narrow window can’t capture long-term climate patterns:\nOver the past 800,000 years (from ice core data), Earth has seen 8 glacial-interglacial cycles, with temperatures fluctuating by 5-10°C naturally.\nEven in the last 2,000 years, we’ve had the Roman Warm Period (250-400 AD), Medieval Warm Period (950-1250 AD), and Little Ice Age (1300-1850 AD)—all driven by natural factors, not human activity.\n\n3. Past Warming and Cooling Without Human Factors\nThe graph implies human factors (greenhouse gases, land use) drive most warming, but history shows otherwise:\nThe Medieval Warm Period was as warm as today in many regions (e.g., Greenland, where Vikings farmed), with no industrial CO₂ emissions.\nThe Little Ice Age saw global cooling, with frozen rivers in Europe, driven by low solar activity and volcanic eruptions—not aerosols or ozone.\nThese natural cycles happened without any of the human factors listed on the chart, proving climate can change dramatically without human influence.\n\nWhat’s Wrong with the Model\n\nIgnores Long-Term Cycles: Dismisses Milankovitch and solar cycles that drive major climate shifts over millennia.\n\nToo Short a Time Frame: 167 years is far too narrow to understand Earth’s natural climate variability.\n\nOverlooks Natural History: Past warming and cooling periods (e.g., Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age) happened without human factors, contradicting the graph’s human-centric focus.\n\nFinal Take\nThis graph cherry-picks a tiny 167-year period and blames humans for warming, ignoring long-term natural cycles like Milankovitch and solar variability that have driven far larger climate shifts for millions of years. History shows warming and cooling can happen naturally—without any human factors—making the model’s focus on greenhouse gases and other human influences MISLEADING.""",2025-03-08T21:15:00Z,/dutch1777real/status/1898482808374358108#m,"['@DanCady', '@randallwcarlson']",,1,0,0,0,0

@grubbshowmedia,"""Climate Change is a natural phenomenon that has occurred throughout Earth's history, independent of human activity. Here's how these natural cycles work:\n\n1. Orbital Variations (Milankovitch Cycles):\n   - Earth's orbit around the Sun changes in shape (eccentricity), its tilt (obliquity) varies, and the direction of its axis (precession) shifts over long periods. These cycles alter the distribution and intensity of solar energy received by different parts of the Earth, leading to climate shifts over tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. For instance, these cycles are known to have played a significant role in the coming and going of ice ages.\n\n2. Solar Radiation Changes:\n   - The Sun's output is not constant; it goes through cycles of higher and lower activity, including sunspot cycles that last about 11 years. Over longer timescales, there are periods of significantly increased or decreased solar output, like the Maunder Minimum, which coincided with a period known as the Little Ice Age in Europe.\n\n3. Volcanic Eruptions:\n   - Large volcanic eruptions can inject massive amounts of aerosols into the stratosphere, which can cool the Earth temporarily by reflecting sunlight back into space. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora, for example, led to the ""Year Without a Summer"" in 1816, where global temperatures dropped significantly.\n\n4. Ocean Currents:\n   - Changes in ocean circulation patterns, like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), can cause regional climate variations. These can shift weather patterns, leading to prolonged periods of drought or heavy rainfall in different parts of the world. Over longer geological timescales, changes in ocean currents have been linked to significant climate shifts.\n\n5. Plate Tectonics:\n   - The movement of continents affects ocean currents, atmospheric circulation patterns, and the distribution of landmasses relative to the poles or equator. For example, when all continents were joined in Pangaea, the climate was different than when they were dispersed as they are now. \n\n6. Atmospheric Composition:\n   - Over geological time, the composition of Earth's atmosphere has changed due to biological activity and geological processes. For instance, the rise of oxygen levels due to photosynthesis fundamentally altered the planet's climate and life forms.\n\n7. Greenhouse Gases from Natural Sources:\n   - Even without human influence, natural processes release greenhouse gases. Methane emissions from wetlands, carbon dioxide from volcanic activity, and nitrous oxide from soil bacteria all contribute to the greenhouse effect, influencing temperature.\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe natural cycles of climate change are complex and occur over various timescales, from decades to millions of years. They show that Earth's climate is inherently dynamic. While these natural forces can lead to significant changes in climate, the current rapid rate of change is largely attributed to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels which has spiked levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases beyond what natural cycles would suggest.\n\nUnderstanding these natural mechanisms doesn't negate human impact but provides a backdrop for how Earth's climate has evolved. It's crucial in climate science to distinguish between what is natural variability and what is anthropogenic change, as this informs policy, adaptation strategies, and mitigation efforts. The interplay between natural cycles and human-induced changes makes the study of climate change a continuously evolving field, with each discovery adding to our understanding of this intricate system.""",2025-01-13T23:35:00Z,/grubbshowmedia/status/1878949045756146095#m,[],,0,0,0,0,1

However, since the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s, humans have burned large amounts of coal, oil, and gas, releasing many greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This has led to a significant increase in Earth's temperatures. In the 20th century, industrial growth and cutting down forests for farming and cities worsened the problem. By the late 1900s, scientists had gathered enough evidence to show that human activities were driving climate change, prompting global efforts to address the issue.

@AstroInsights_,"""Solar activity changes have some impact on Earth's climate, although most scientists agree that current climate change is primarily driven by human activities rather than natural solar cycles. The Sun has an approximately 11-year activity cycle, with variations in sunspots and solar radiation. During the solar maximum, solar radiation is slightly stronger, while it is weaker during the solar minimum.\n\nSolar radiation, or the solar constant, varies by about 0.1% throughout the cycle. This small change can affect the climate system, particularly when combined with other factors. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun also fluctuates during the cycle, impacting the upper atmosphere, especially the stratosphere, and influencing the ozone layer and stratospheric temperature.\n\nHistorically, periods of low solar activity, such as the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715), corresponded with colder climate conditions in Europe and North America, known as the Little Ice Age. Another period, the Dalton Minimum (1790–1830), also aligned with cooler temperatures.\n\nWhile solar activity changes have some influence on Earth's climate, they are not the primary driver of modern climate change. Human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases, have a much more significant impact on global temperatures and climate conditions.""",2024-07-25T11:51:00Z,/AstroInsights_/status/1816441082898501678#m,[],,0,0,0,0,1

The trend in the direction of this wobble relative to the fixed positions of stars is known as axial precession.

Currently perihelion occurs during winter in the Northern Hemisphere and in summer in the Southern Hemisphere. This makes Southern Hemisphere summers hotter and moderates Northern Hemisphere seasonal variations.

Does it really have something to do with skin color, or just fear of the illegal ones? \n\nWho would you blame for what? Where do we start? Why are we always talking about this and getting not result? Who's right? Who's wrong? Where's the truth and what is it? \n\nAr least, future total population overgrowth is something no one can deny. The sooner we start slowing down (at the SAME PACE everywhere on earth, to prevent future world wars), the softer it will be to do it. For exemple, China did this for a long period: One child/family. That was way toodrastic at my opinion. But, was it necessary, in their situation? Maybe? If so, would have it been wiser to start earlier, so that they can limit families to have 2 children instead of one? Well, I think so!\n\nIf we don't do it now, brace yourselves because there will be people who will think that the only solution left will be to whipe out part of the population, and no one want that, or at least, not me 😅""",2024-05-26T16:14:00Z,/StopSophisms/status/1794764069381005487#m,"['@johnnyrokketz', '@MarioNawfal']",,0,0,0,0,1
