@AbiluTangwa,Plant-Based Diets 🌱 Adopting a plant-based diet can significantly reduce your carbon footprint. The production of meat and dairy is resource-intensive and contributes to deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. By choosing more plant-based meals&#44; we can lessen our impact on the environment and promote better health. Every meal is an opportunity to make a positive change. #PlantBased #SustainableEating,"Jul 8, 2025 · 12:23 AM UTC",/AbiluTangwa/status/1942379036761538814#m,0,7,19,1

@kevinmd,Plant based diets can reduce disease severity and risk factors.  Plant-based diets might just be the secret weapon against severe illness.  During the pandemic&#44; a study across six countries found a 73% lower chance of moderate to severe disease among those who followed a plant-based diet.  Why? Antioxidants from fruits and veggies fight inflammation and tackle risk factors like heart disease&#44; obesity&#44; and type 2 diabetes.  Long-term studies and clinical trials even suggest these diets can treat and potentially reverse some conditions.  Have you experienced any benefits from a plant-based diet?
