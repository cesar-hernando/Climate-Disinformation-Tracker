@TRUTHSEEKERS111,Joe Rogan Podcast: Are Electric Cars Significantly Worse for the Environment?    Electric vehicles release more toxic emissions and are worse for the environment than gas-powered cars. Study. This is in the New York Post. Brakes and tires on EVs released 1&#44;850 times more particle pollution compared to modern tailpipes. Today&#44; most vehicle-related pollution comes from tire wear.  Woah. Because EVs are an average of 30% heavier&#44; brakes and tires in the battery-powered cars wear out faster than on standard cars. That's something that someone had told me a long time ago about cities. The thing about the pollution is it's not just the emissions&#44; it's brake dust. Yeah.  That you're breathing in brake dust because if you've ever&#44; like&#44; touched your car&#44; you drive it for a while&#44; get brake dust everywhere&#44; just all over the inside.

@IdgiusAlpha,🚨 CANADA BANS GAS CARS WITHOUT A VOTE — FULL ELECTRIC MANDATE FORCED ON CITIZENS BY 2035! 🚨  No debate. No vote. Just pure authoritarianism. Canada’s radical Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault quietly rewrote CEPA — the Canadian Environmental Protection Act — and now by 2035&#44; buying a gas or even a hybrid car will be ILLEGAL. The plan? 2026: 20% of new cars MUST be electric 2030: 60% 2035: 100% — or else.  This is what happens when climate extremism replaces democracy. No public input&#44; no Parliament vote — just a unilateral power grab crushing freedom and choice. And while Canadians are forced into unaffordable EVs&#44; leaders like Trudeau are driving this agenda at the expense of working people.  Meanwhile&#44; voices like former MP Ryan Williams are raising serious questions: What if Canada joined the U.S. as the 51st state? Open trade&#44; lower taxes&#44; energy freedom&#44; and no more environmental tyranny. But Trudeau’s crew laughs it off — while ignoring the real economic and political pain they’re inflicting on their own people.  President Trump fights for energy independence&#44; freedom of choice&#44; and real leadership. What’s happening in Canada is a warning to us ALL.  Stand up&#44; speak out&#44; and defend freedom before it’s gone. @TaraBull808 @WallStreetApes #EVMandateMadness #Trump2024 #FreedomOfChoice,2025-05-04T17:52:00Z,/IdgiusAlpha/status/1919087704530374949#m,1,2,3,0

@ElizabethFarah,👉🏼GREEN NEW SCAM :: Remember the NY Post's story on EV cars having a greater negative impact on the environment than gas vehicles? 👈🏼 🧵  Electric vehicles release more toxic particles into the atmosphere and are worse for the environment than their gas-powered counterparts&#44; according to a resurfaced study.  The study&#44; published by emissions data firm Emission Analytics&#44; was released in 2022 but has attracted a wave of attention this week after being cited in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Sunday.  It found that brakes and tires on EVs release 1&#44;850 times more particle pollution compared to modern tailpipes&#44; which have “efficient” exhaust filters&#44; bringing gas-powered vehicles’ emissions to new lows.  Today&#44; most vehicle-related pollution comes from tire wear. As heavy cars drive on light-duty tires — most often made with synthetic rubber made from crude oil and other fillers and additives — they deteriorate and release harmful chemicals into the air&#44; according to Emission Analytics  Because EVs are on average 30% heavier&#44; brakes and tires on the battery-powered cars wear out faster than on standard cars.,2024-10-17T14:18:00Z,/ElizabethFarah/status/1846918691708879321#m,1,0,0,0

But they are expensive and have multiple problems including impacts on environment.   Gas powered cars are unbeatable so far . And flexible and affordable.

The push against gas cars is nothing but a way of selling electric ones.  They are more expensive&#44; and their batteries have short lifespans.  This means they need to be replaced OFTEN.  How much does this cost?  10-20k 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣  You're barely (if at all) helping the environment.   Your carbon emissions are coming from the cash you're burning.

@1984Disrupter,""" Electric vehicles release more toxic emissions&#44; are worse for the environment than gas-powered cars: study 👇  Electric vehicles release more toxic particles into the atmosphere and are worse for the environment than their gas-powered counterparts&#44; according to a resurfaced study.  The study&#44; published by emissions data firm Emission Analytics&#44; was released in 2022 but has attracted a wave of attention this week after being cited in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Sunday.  It found that brakes and tires on EVs release 1&#44;850 times more particle pollution compared to modern tailpipes&#44; which have “efficient” exhaust filters&#44; bringing gas-powered vehicles’ emissions to new lows.  Today&#44; most vehicle-related pollution comes from tire wear.  As heavy cars drive on light-duty tires — most often made with synthetic rubber made from crude oil and other fillers and additives — they deteriorate and release harmful chemicals into the air&#44; according to Emission Analytics.""  Og fra før vet vi altså at CO2 IKKE er forurensing. CO2 er en helt nødvendig gass for alt livet på jorden&#44; og menneskenes egen pust er den største bidragsyteren&#44; og halveres CO2-nivået vil vi alle dø. Jo da&#44; CO2 er en klimagass&#44; men har de facto så beskjeden varmeeffekt gjennom atmosfæren at det knapt er målbart. Metan derimot&#44; har en slik varmeeeffekt. Den gassen er det imidlertid så lite av i atmosfæren at det heller ikke er målbart.   Så&#44; hvorfor fortsetter du å la deg lure av imbesile politikere???? Åh&#44; du blir egentlig ikke lurt&#44; men er bare fryktelig redd for å fremstå som klimafornekter! Skjønner.😉",2024-03-06T13:34:00Z,/1984Disrupter/status/1765370276886311120#m,0,0,0,0

@craigkellyAFEE,THE ELECTRIC CAR FALLACY   It’s a myth that EV’s are better for the environment.   dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/…  The EVs have increased weight due to their lithium-ion batteries which causes the tire treads to wear faster&#44; ultimately producing more emissions.  wsj.com/articles/electric-ca…  The Biden administration is reviewing California’s plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. To get federal approval&#44; California claims it “needs” this ban to prevent harm to public health from particulate matter—airborne particles like dust&#44; dirt and soot. But banning gasoline cars would do little to reduce particulate emissions&#44; and it could even increase them.,2024-03-06T11:56:00Z,/craigkellyAFEE/status/1765345727893635443#m,11,22,72,3

@LearnToToad,There's no way moving to all electric vehicles by imposition isn't going to be even worse for the environment. You'll need so much fuel to charge the cars the amount of fossil fuel usage would have to increase so the whole thing wouldn't collapse&#44; and the car batteries are created with mined lithium.

@DebbieLesko,Democrat-run California is banning gas-powered cars by 2035. The average cost of an electric vehicle is around $67&#44;000&#44; & the state’s electric grid already can’t keep the lights on. This will be an energy disaster.
