@felipefreitasm1,Plant-based diets are a great way to improve your health and reduce your carbon footprint. Let's embrace a more sustainable way of eating! ����,2025-08-16T22:46:00Z,/felipefreitasm1/status/1956850002367840532#m,0,0,0,0
@AbiluTangwa,Plant-Based Diets 🌱 Adopting a plant-based diet can significantly reduce your carbon footprint. The production of meat and dairy is resource-intensive and contributes to deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. By choosing more plant-based meals&#44; we can lessen our impact on the environment and promote better health. Every meal is an opportunity to make a positive change. #PlantBased #SustainableEating,2025-07-08T00:23:00Z,/AbiluTangwa/status/1942379036761538814#m,0,8,19,1

@kevinmd,Plant based diets can reduce disease severity and risk factors.  Plant-based diets might just be the secret weapon against severe illness.  During the pandemic&#44; a study across six countries found a 73% lower chance of moderate to severe disease among those who followed a plant-based diet.  Why? Antioxidants from fruits and veggies fight inflammation and tackle risk factors like heart disease&#44; obesity&#44; and type 2 diabetes.  Long-term studies and clinical trials even suggest these diets can treat and potentially reverse some conditions.  Have you experienced any benefits from a plant-based diet?
