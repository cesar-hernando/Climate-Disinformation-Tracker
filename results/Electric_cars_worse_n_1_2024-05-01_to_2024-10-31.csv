@ElizabethFarah,👉🏼GREEN NEW SCAM :: Remember the NY Post's story on EV cars having a greater negative impact on the environment than gas vehicles? 👈🏼 🧵  Electric vehicles release more toxic particles into the atmosphere and are worse for the environment than their gas-powered counterparts&#44; according to a resurfaced study.  The study&#44; published by emissions data firm Emission Analytics&#44; was released in 2022 but has attracted a wave of attention this week after being cited in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Sunday.  It found that brakes and tires on EVs release 1&#44;850 times more particle pollution compared to modern tailpipes&#44; which have “efficient” exhaust filters&#44; bringing gas-powered vehicles’ emissions to new lows.  Today&#44; most vehicle-related pollution comes from tire wear. As heavy cars drive on light-duty tires — most often made with synthetic rubber made from crude oil and other fillers and additives — they deteriorate and release harmful chemicals into the air&#44; according to Emission Analytics  Because EVs are on average 30% heavier&#44; brakes and tires on the battery-powered cars wear out faster than on standard cars.,"Oct 17, 2024 · 2:18 PM UTC",/ElizabethFarah/status/1846918691708879321#m,1,0,0,0

@IAmTheStorm__,It’s been proven that electric cars are actually worse for the environment. They are also much heavier and every bridge and every road would have to be upgraded at massive costs&#44; not only monetarily but environmentally. Can you imagine taking every fuel powered car&#44; truck&#44; tractor&#44; train&#44; plane etc. and putting them in a landfill? Someone who purchased an old car junk yard (the cars were gone) and turned it into a home&#44; we found pieces of carpet&#44; which do not disintegrate&#44; buried in the ground when landscaping. For a while old antennas and car parts would resurface after hard rains. The vehicles do not go away. Stop with the electric nonsense and make fuel powered vehicles more efficient. You can’t convince me the technologies are not there.,"Jun 5, 2024 · 2:50 AM UTC",/IAmTheStorm__/status/1798185715173396529#m,1,1,1,0
