@DASingh8,Climate change is caused by natural phenomena. It can be caused by volcanoes&#44; solar cycles&#44; ocean currents&#44; etc. but not by CO2. You have CO2 in your body right now. It is necessary for the survival of the planet. Only brain-dead idiots&#44; like Democrats&#44; think it must be removed.,2025-09-08T19:19:00Z,/DASingh8/status/1965132948979741036#m,0,0,0,0
@greenlenss,🌍 What is the GREENHOUSE EFFECT? It’s Earth’s natural heat shield—gases like CO₂ & water vapor trap some of the Sun’s heat&#44; keeping the planet warm & habitable. ⚠️ But human-caused emissions of these gases intensify the effect → global warming & climate change. #ClimateChange,2025-09-08T14:20:00Z,/greenlenss/status/1965057608236335445#m,1,5,9,1

@JimSheehy1,I would love to see actual data presented in court that shows that fossil fuels have caused climate change as opposed to the many other natural and cyclical cycles of climate change. Has fossil fuel caused more change than solar cycles&#44; ocean current patterns&#44; volcano eruptions&#44; etc.? Has fossil fuel use provided more benefits than harm? Will the conversion of massive amount of farm and other land for use by solar and wind farms cause more harm than good? What are the lifecycle costs of converting to EVs&#44; solar and wind versus fossil fuels? Which is more costly for consumers&#44; and which can help poor&#44; developing countries better escape poverty? Laws like these that are based on the whims of Democrats in Democrat run states need to be challenged if they are not based on science.

@grubbshowmedia,"Climate Change is a natural phenomenon that has occurred throughout Earth's history&#44; independent of human activity. Here's how these natural cycles work:  1. Orbital Variations (Milankovitch Cycles):    - Earth's orbit around the Sun changes in shape (eccentricity)&#44; its tilt (obliquity) varies&#44; and the direction of its axis (precession) shifts over long periods. These cycles alter the distribution and intensity of solar energy received by different parts of the Earth&#44; leading to climate shifts over tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. For instance&#44; these cycles are known to have played a significant role in the coming and going of ice ages.  2. Solar Radiation Changes:    - The Sun's output is not constant; it goes through cycles of higher and lower activity&#44; including sunspot cycles that last about 11 years. Over longer timescales&#44; there are periods of significantly increased or decreased solar output&#44; like the Maunder Minimum&#44; which coincided with a period known as the Little Ice Age in Europe.  3. Volcanic Eruptions:    - Large volcanic eruptions can inject massive amounts of aerosols into the stratosphere&#44; which can cool the Earth temporarily by reflecting sunlight back into space. The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora&#44; for example&#44; led to the ""Year Without a Summer"" in 1816&#44; where global temperatures dropped significantly.  4. Ocean Currents:    - Changes in ocean circulation patterns&#44; like the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)&#44; can cause regional climate variations. These can shift weather patterns&#44; leading to prolonged periods of drought or heavy rainfall in different parts of the world. Over longer geological timescales&#44; changes in ocean currents have been linked to significant climate shifts.  5. Plate Tectonics:    - The movement of continents affects ocean currents&#44; atmospheric circulation patterns&#44; and the distribution of landmasses relative to the poles or equator. For example&#44; when all continents were joined in Pangaea&#44; the climate was different than when they were dispersed as they are now.   6. Atmospheric Composition:    - Over geological time&#44; the composition of Earth's atmosphere has changed due to biological activity and geological processes. For instance&#44; the rise of oxygen levels due to photosynthesis fundamentally altered the planet's climate and life forms.  7. Greenhouse Gases from Natural Sources:    - Even without human influence&#44; natural processes release greenhouse gases. Methane emissions from wetlands&#44; carbon dioxide from volcanic activity&#44; and nitrous oxide from soil bacteria all contribute to the greenhouse effect&#44; influencing temperature.  Discussion:  The natural cycles of climate change are complex and occur over various timescales&#44; from decades to millions of years. They show that Earth's climate is inherently dynamic. While these natural forces can lead to significant changes in climate&#44; the current rapid rate of change is largely attributed to human activities&#44; particularly the burning of fossil fuels which has spiked levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases beyond what natural cycles would suggest.  Understanding these natural mechanisms doesn't negate human impact but provides a backdrop for how Earth's climate has evolved. It's crucial in climate science to distinguish between what is natural variability and what is anthropogenic change&#44; as this informs policy&#44; adaptation strategies&#44; and mitigation efforts. The interplay between natural cycles and human-induced changes makes the study of climate change a continuously evolving field&#44; with each discovery adding to our understanding of this intricate system.",2025-01-13T23:35:00Z,/grubbshowmedia/status/1878949045756146095#m,0,0,0,0

@GerardAMorrow,Climate changes all the time&#44; so it can't be a hoax. The Earth warms and cools cyclically through natural causes&#44; the main one being pulled further from the Sun and pushed nearer to the Sun over around 1000 year cycles. 1000 years ago the the World was as warm&#44; or warmer than today with a much smaller global population and not a single petrol engine on the planet. So climate change isn't a hoax&#44; and humans contributing to it isn't a hoax. Using the output of computer models&#44; of a chaotic&#44; non-linear system&#44; and pretending to be able to forecast catastrophes is a hoax.

@AstroInsights_,Solar activity changes have some impact on Earth's climate&#44; although most scientists agree that current climate change is primarily driven by human activities rather than natural solar cycles. The Sun has an approximately 11-year activity cycle&#44; with variations in sunspots and solar radiation. During the solar maximum&#44; solar radiation is slightly stronger&#44; while it is weaker during the solar minimum.  Solar radiation&#44; or the solar constant&#44; varies by about 0.1% throughout the cycle. This small change can affect the climate system&#44; particularly when combined with other factors. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun also fluctuates during the cycle&#44; impacting the upper atmosphere&#44; especially the stratosphere&#44; and influencing the ozone layer and stratospheric temperature.  Historically&#44; periods of low solar activity&#44; such as the Maunder Minimum (1645–1715)&#44; corresponded with colder climate conditions in Europe and North America&#44; known as the Little Ice Age. Another period&#44; the Dalton Minimum (1790–1830)&#44; also aligned with cooler temperatures.  While solar activity changes have some influence on Earth's climate&#44; they are not the primary driver of modern climate change. Human activities&#44; particularly the emission of greenhouse gases&#44; have a much more significant impact on global temperatures and climate conditions.,2024-07-25T11:51:00Z,/AstroInsights_/status/1816441082898501678#m,0,0,0,0
@JChimirie66677,Milankovitch (Orbital) Cycles and Their Role in Earth’s Climate  Precession – As Earth rotates&#44; it wobbles slightly upon its rotational axis&#44; like a slightly off-center spinning toy top. This wobble is due to tidal forces caused by the gravitational influences of the Sun and Moon that cause Earth to bulge at the equator&#44; affecting its rotation. The trend in the direction of this wobble relative to the fixed positions of stars is known as axial precession. The cycle of axial precession spans about 25&#44;771.5 years.  Axial precession makes seasonal contrasts more extreme in one hemisphere and less extreme in the other. Currently perihelion occurs during winter in the Northern Hemisphere and in summer in the Southern Hemisphere. This makes Southern Hemisphere summers hotter and moderates Northern Hemisphere seasonal variations. But in about 13&#44;000 years&#44; axial precession will cause these conditions to flip&#44; with the Northern Hemisphere seeing more extremes in solar radiation and the Southern Hemisphere experiencing more moderate seasonal variations. science.nasa.gov/science-res…,2024-07-23T18:12:00Z,/JChimirie66677/status/1815812289422831970#m,0,0,1,1

@Clarsonimus,#ClimateCrisis Fun Facts: Natural #climate variability consists of various cycles. Some are related to variations in solar luminosity&#44; tidal effects of the Sun and Moon as well as the gravitational and electromagnetic oscillations of the heliosphere due to the revolution of the planets around the Sun. This interplanetary electromagnetic effect also modulates cosmic ray intensity which affects Earth's cloud formation. #CO2 #Fear #Industry,2024-06-12T08:14:00Z,/Clarsonimus/status/1800803837772460226#m,0,3,3,2

Between the Sun and it’s solar maximum&#44; the earth and its natural environmental cycles&#44; and the axis of the earth which is wobbling more now than we realized&#44; Canada is indeed becoming warmer. We can not alter these things&#44; they happen whether we’re here or not and no amount of taxes or reduction in fossil fuels is going to change that.

@FerretScot,🔴 FACT CHECK: A widely repeated suggestion by climate sceptics online is that climate change observed in recent decades is part of a natural cycle of weather that is not linked to human causes.   The claim is False ❌ bit.ly/3XZiMdp?utm_source=Tw…,2023-07-18T07:00:00Z,/FerretScot/status/1681197160132427776#m,1,19,20,4
@RoyD27112543,Canon of the Earth's Insolation   characterizes the climates of all the planets of the Solar System.  Earth's long-term climate changes caused by changes in the position of the Earth in comparison to the Sun&#44; now known as Milankovitch cycles.,2023-07-18T02:14:00Z,/RoyD27112543/status/1681125273486360576#m,0,0,0,0
@xtp03,Blocking the sun to combat climate change is a dangerous proposition. It ignores the complex&#44; interrelated nature of our planet and the long-term effects. We risk disrupting natural cycles&#44; potentially causing more harm than good. #ClimateCrisis invidious.tiekoetter.com/6SsJZkT0MmU,2023-07-16T18:08:00Z,/xtp03/status/1680640660964282373#m,0,0,1,0
@StevePratico,"Yep.  The biggest factor in ""Climate Change"" or ""Global Warming"" is the ONE THING they cannot control.  The sun. And natural cycles of solar events.  More sun = more WATER VAPOR and clouds in the atmosphere. It's not CO2 that is ""the problem"".  This sounds very simplistic. It is.",2023-07-15T16:33:00Z,/StevePratico/status/1680254380317229056#m,0,0,0,0
@TheRomanoReport,The factors that affect climate are exceedingly complex.  They include sun cycles&#44; changes in the orientation of the Earth and its orbit&#44; and YES&#44; it includes changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere&#44; both natural and anthropogenic.,2023-07-14T21:13:00Z,/TheRomanoReport/status/1679962300306923521#m,0,1,6,0
@AldnoahVoid,"Polluters cause environmental damages but what RFK Jr. observed from when he was a kid to now is not ""Climate Change"" caused by C02 & methane but a clear indication of the Earth's orbit around the sun & tilt changes...hence climate change is natural!",2023-07-13T00:56:00Z,/AldnoahVoid/status/1679293707751759879#m,1,0,2,0
@NOVAeducation,Yesterday&#44; the Earth was at its furthest point from the sun&#44; known as aphelion. It may seem counterintuitive&#44; especially given the record-breaking heat&#44; but it's true!

@samfrob5,An entire field of “bought” science. Many scientists agree that climate change is a natural cycle caused by variations in the orbit of the earth around the sun and not by mankind. In the 70’s we were told we would run out of oil by 2000. Many false predictions.,2023-07-03T07:44:00Z,/samfrob5/status/1675772539866431491#m,2,0,1,0
@Justice_forum,Absolute load of codswallop! 😡  Climate change is a natural phenomenon as the sun and earth progress through various cycles.  Humans are inconsequential in these phases and will never make any difference.,2023-06-29T10:28:00Z,/Justice_forum/status/1674364102683099139#m,12,23,67,4

@samfrob5,Why do you say this when it is not true?  Look at the evidence rather than what you have been told. Open your eyes and your brain. Climate change is a natural phenomenon caused by the orbit of the earth around the sun. It is not mankind driven.,2023-06-16T20:57:00Z,/samfrob5/status/1669811472501702656#m,7,0,0,0

@DominickAlbano3,Wildfires are not caused by climate change&#44; they are part of Earth's natural cycles and are increasingly started by humans. But the conditions that make wildfires more intense and severe are strongly linked to human-induced changes in the climate.  abcnews.go.com/US/canadas-wi…,2023-06-08T18:30:00Z,/DominickAlbano3/status/1666875237328359425#m,0,0,1,0
