@BtrClngrUBetcha,Variability of the climate on Earth is part of natural cycles that impact the orbit and tilt of the Earth relative to the Sun. Changes in SOLAR output can have significant impacts here&#44; as in the Maunder Minimum output&#44; which caused the Little Ice Age. space.com/earth-sun-relation…,2024-09-21T01:32:00Z,/BtrClngrUBetcha/status/1837303875419660595#m,0,0,0,0
@TheHerald_Sun,Researchers say climate change caused by humans plays a key role&#44; even if natural cycles are part of the reason.  heraldsun.com/news/politics-…,2023-04-14T10:30:00Z,/TheHerald_Sun/status/1646823162456207360#m,0,0,0,0
@BkennedyBarbara,⬇️⬇️ and would you be crying the blues about melting ice if half the Northern hemisphere was covered with ice&#44; like 12&#44;000 years ago.  BTW there have been regular climate warmings and coolings since the big melt; all caused by natural cycles&#44; sun’s activity and random events,2023-04-03T13:40:00Z,/BkennedyBarbara/status/1642884906186608641#m,1,1,1,0
@silentstorm012,Here we go again. I am not a climate change denier. On the contrary&#44; climate change is obvious&#44; getting hotter&#44; droughts&#44; natural disaster on the rise&#44; but only some of it is caused by us. It’s Earth’s weather cycles&#44; Sun’s influence. Harsh reality&#44; but we can’t fix it.,2022-08-21T23:21:00Z,/silentstorm012/status/1561493750550892545#m,0,0,0,0
@ji34381503,Climate change is not caused by mankind…it is caused by the natural cycles of the sun. We are moving out of a warm cycle into a very cold cycle,2022-07-17T18:03:00Z,/ji34381503/status/1548730212044525568#m,0,0,0,0
@michael407931,I believe in climate change&#44; but not that it was caused by us. It has to do with natural cycles and earth's orbit and declination around the sun. Did you know earth was once a complete ball of ice for hundreds of millions of years? #climate #science #weather,2022-05-19T14:49:00Z,/michael407931/status/1527300537909379077#m,0,0,0,0
@LlareggubJ,I don't. Climate change is mainly caused by the Milankovitch Cycles and other natural phenomena. It has always changed and always will until the Sun dies.,2021-10-15T05:04:00Z,/LlareggubJ/status/1448877537711513615#m,0,0,0,0

@27Legin,He saw the light that he could earn millions by joining the warmists who pretend the man can change the climate. All climate events are natural&#44; and caused by the cycles of the sun. It’s very arrogant to believe we can overpower the sun!,2021-08-03T09:21:00Z,/27Legin/status/1422487672719908865#m,1,0,1,0
@BkennedyBarbara,Truer words were never spoken!  Climate is a result of natural cycles&#44; random events and sun’s energy level.  Now Google the year without summer.

@navstadt,gab.com/TheEpochTimes/posts/…  Human caused Climate change is unadulterated BULLSHIT. Climate change is a natural phenomenon caused by the cycles of our sun. Humans are responsible for less that 1/2% if that of it. IMHO/IMPO! Stop buying into the lie pushed by monopolies for profits.,2021-05-12T16:02:00Z,/navstadt/status/1392510509409243144#m,0,0,1,0
@joshofar,Aside from natural climate cycles of warming/cooling caused by the Sun&#44; there is no such thing as “Global Warming.” For years they have been trying to convince us that a few billion people are capable of releasing more climate-altering energy than a Star.

@corneliajames25,Another Democrat scare tactic to bankrupt America. “Climate change” are natural cycles that are mainly caused by the sun&#44; volcanoes&#44; & the oceans. Humans have little to no impact on C02 levels.

@Arkil_Morel,So if climate change is being driven by the Sun and not humans what do we do about it?  Climate change is happening&#44; so it nees to be addressed whether it's caused by natural cycles or human activity.  So what do climate change skeptics propose?  #ClimateChange #gretathumberg,2019-08-19T15:48:00Z,/Arkil_Morel/status/1163477758145683456#m,2,0,0,0

@AgataBabette,Climate change is settled science-  It is caused by natural factors 1- plate techtonics  2- change in tilt of earth's axis (yes it changes)  3- change in sun's solar output  4- change in wind currents   That's it.   So tell the anti CO2 folks to chill.  Climate cycles and changes,2019-05-27T22:07:00Z,/AgataBabette/status/1133132708043997186#m,0,0,0,0
