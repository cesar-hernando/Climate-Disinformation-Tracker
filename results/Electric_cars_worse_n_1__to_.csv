@TRUTHSEEKERS111,Joe Rogan Podcast: Are Electric Cars Significantly Worse for the Environment?    Electric vehicles release more toxic emissions and are worse for the environment than gas-powered cars. Study. This is in the New York Post. Brakes and tires on EVs released 1&#44;850 times more particle pollution compared to modern tailpipes. Today&#44; most vehicle-related pollution comes from tire wear.  Woah. Because EVs are an average of 30% heavier&#44; brakes and tires in the battery-powered cars wear out faster than on standard cars. That's something that someone had told me a long time ago about cities. The thing about the pollution is it's not just the emissions&#44; it's brake dust. Yeah.  That you're breathing in brake dust because if you've ever&#44; like&#44; touched your car&#44; you drive it for a while&#44; get brake dust everywhere&#44; just all over the inside.

@ElizabethFarah,👉🏼GREEN NEW SCAM :: Remember the NY Post's story on EV cars having a greater negative impact on the environment than gas vehicles? 👈🏼 🧵  Electric vehicles release more toxic particles into the atmosphere and are worse for the environment than their gas-powered counterparts&#44; according to a resurfaced study.  The study&#44; published by emissions data firm Emission Analytics&#44; was released in 2022 but has attracted a wave of attention this week after being cited in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Sunday.  It found that brakes and tires on EVs release 1&#44;850 times more particle pollution compared to modern tailpipes&#44; which have “efficient” exhaust filters&#44; bringing gas-powered vehicles’ emissions to new lows.  Today&#44; most vehicle-related pollution comes from tire wear. As heavy cars drive on light-duty tires — most often made with synthetic rubber made from crude oil and other fillers and additives — they deteriorate and release harmful chemicals into the air&#44; according to Emission Analytics  Because EVs are on average 30% heavier&#44; brakes and tires on the battery-powered cars wear out faster than on standard cars.,"Oct 17, 2024 · 2:18 PM UTC",/ElizabethFarah/status/1846918691708879321#m,1,0,0,0

But they are expensive and have multiple problems including impacts on environment.   Gas powered cars are unbeatable so far . And flexible and affordable.

@1984Disrupter,""" Electric vehicles release more toxic emissions&#44; are worse for the environment than gas-powered cars: study 👇  Electric vehicles release more toxic particles into the atmosphere and are worse for the environment than their gas-powered counterparts&#44; according to a resurfaced study.  The study&#44; published by emissions data firm Emission Analytics&#44; was released in 2022 but has attracted a wave of attention this week after being cited in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Sunday.  It found that brakes and tires on EVs release 1&#44;850 times more particle pollution compared to modern tailpipes&#44; which have “efficient” exhaust filters&#44; bringing gas-powered vehicles’ emissions to new lows.  Today&#44; most vehicle-related pollution comes from tire wear.  As heavy cars drive on light-duty tires — most often made with synthetic rubber made from crude oil and other fillers and additives — they deteriorate and release harmful chemicals into the air&#44; according to Emission Analytics.""  Og fra før vet vi altså at CO2 IKKE er forurensing. CO2 er en helt nødvendig gass for alt livet på jorden&#44; og menneskenes egen pust er den største bidragsyteren&#44; og halveres CO2-nivået vil vi alle dø. Jo da&#44; CO2 er en klimagass&#44; men har de facto så beskjeden varmeeffekt gjennom atmosfæren at det knapt er målbart. Metan derimot&#44; har en slik varmeeeffekt. Den gassen er det imidlertid så lite av i atmosfæren at det heller ikke er målbart.   Så&#44; hvorfor fortsetter du å la deg lure av imbesile politikere???? Åh&#44; du blir egentlig ikke lurt&#44; men er bare fryktelig redd for å fremstå som klimafornekter! Skjønner.😉","Mar 6, 2024 · 1:34 PM UTC",/1984Disrupter/status/1765370276886311120#m,0,0,0,0

@craigkellyAFEE,THE ELECTRIC CAR FALLACY   It’s a myth that EV’s are better for the environment.   dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/…  The EVs have increased weight due to their lithium-ion batteries which causes the tire treads to wear faster&#44; ultimately producing more emissions.  wsj.com/articles/electric-ca…  The Biden administration is reviewing California’s plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035. To get federal approval&#44; California claims it “needs” this ban to prevent harm to public health from particulate matter—airborne particles like dust&#44; dirt and soot. But banning gasoline cars would do little to reduce particulate emissions&#44; and it could even increase them.,"Mar 6, 2024 · 11:56 AM UTC",/craigkellyAFEE/status/1765345727893635443#m,11,22,72,3
