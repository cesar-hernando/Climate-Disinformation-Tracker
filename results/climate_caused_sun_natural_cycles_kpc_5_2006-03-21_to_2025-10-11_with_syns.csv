@DASingh8,Climate change is caused by natural phenomena. It can be caused by volcanoes&#44; solar cycles&#44; ocean currents&#44; etc. but not by CO2. You have CO2 in your body right now. It is necessary for the survival of the planet. Only brain-dead idiots&#44; like Democrats&#44; think it must be removed.,2025-09-08T19:19:00Z,/DASingh8/status/1965132948979741036#m,0,0,0,0
@JimSheehy1,I would love to see actual data presented in court that shows that fossil fuels have caused climate change as opposed to the many other natural and cyclical cycles of climate change. Has fossil fuel caused more change than solar cycles&#44; ocean current patterns&#44; volcano eruptions&#44; etc.? Has fossil fuel use provided more benefits than harm? Will the conversion of massive amount of farm and other land for use by solar and wind farms cause more harm than good? What are the lifecycle costs of converting to EVs&#44; solar and wind versus fossil fuels? Which is more costly for consumers&#44; and which can help poor&#44; developing countries better escape poverty? Laws like these that are based on the whims of Democrats in Democrat run states need to be challenged if they are not based on science.

@climatederange,Earth’s climate has always fluctuated. The Medieval Warm Period (950-1250 AD) had temperatures similar to today&#44; driven by natural cycles like solar activity—not CO2. What caused warming then if not industrialization? 🌍 #ClimateScam,2024-12-30T17:32:00Z,/climatederange/status/1873784265252757690#m,0,0,0,0
@salvazion_,Why is climate change or global warming a lie that does not exist?  1. Natural Cycles: Some argue that climate has always changed due to natural cycles like solar activity or Earth's orbital variations&#44; suggesting that current changes are not human-induced. This perspective was highlighted in posts found on X&#44; where users claim that climate change is part of the Earth's organic cycles and not a crisis caused by human activities.  2. Manufactured Consensus: There is a claim that the scientific consensus on climate change is manufactured by various global entities for political or financial gain. This idea was expressed in posts where climate change is described as a scam created to benefit globalist agendas or control energy markets.  3. Historical Temperatures: Critics sometimes point out that Earth has been warmer in the past&#44; implying that current warming trends are neither unusual nor human-caused. This argument was noted in posts where historical temperature data is used to challenge current climate science.  #Qolitica #ClimateChange #BiodiversityLoss #TemperatureRise #SeaLevelRise #OceanAcidification #ExtremeWeatherEvents,2024-12-19T15:47:00Z,/salvazion_/status/1869771628051148988#m,3,1,4,0
