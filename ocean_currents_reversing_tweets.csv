@chrismbrock,Delamination of Atlantic Ocean Floor September 2025 C Brock  Folks we stand at a remarkable moment in history. Around the globe creation is stirring. With earthquake swarms in unexpected places&#44; the Atlantic current system reversing and vast rifts widening through the heart of Africa. Into this backdrop comes a startling scientific discovery that portions of the Atlantic Ocean floor are undergoing lithospheric delamination. This is where the dense root of the oceanic plate begins to peel away and sink into the mantle beneath. This reality folks calls us to lift our eyes and recognize the times.  Let us first grasp the magnitude of what I am telling you.  Delamination is not a simple subduction trench where one plate slides under another.  It is the deep lower layer of a plate&#44; heavy and unstable detaching and slowly foundering into the mantle. Imagine the base of an enormous floating raft becoming waterlogged and sinking while the surface above strains to remain intact.   Over the last 6000 years this thin overlying crust changes the height of the seafloor and redirects the currents of the oceans.  This process is releasing stress across adjoining plates and this explains the recent surge in earthquakes in regions far from traditional fault zones.  This is also shifting the balance of heat and salinity that drives the great Atlantic circulation&#44; the conveyor belt that moderates climates from the equator to the poles.  The ripple effects are going to be far reaching.  Altered currents mean changing storm tracks and new pressure on global food and water systems. This slowly subsiding basin is subtly reshaping coastlines and will trigger volcanic responses along mid ocean ridges.  Even the dramatic rift running through East Africa which is the slow tearing of a continent&#44; is part of the same global adjustment as the deep mantle redistributes its weight.  These changes will appear suddenly and the social consequences will come quickly.  Yet there is a deeper meaning and it is spiritual. Scripture tells us that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time. Jesus warned that before His return there would be great earthquakes in various places.  The prophets saw the earth itself reeling like a drunkard under the weight of human rebellion. With the Atlantic plate delaminating&#44; the pattern is unmistakable. The created order itself testifies that this world is temporary and that its Maker will not remain silent forever.  So folks we come to the vision given to John in Revelation 6. When the sixth seal is opened he says “there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth&#44; the whole moon became like blood&#44; and the stars of the sky fell to the earth… and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.”  This is the language from human conflict and geological upheaval. Creation itself convulses as the Lamb who was slain rises to judge and to redeem. With the scientists detecting the deep foundations of the Atlantic shifting&#44; it is a powerful signpost reminding us that this day is approaching sooner rather than later. The earth will not hold its current state forever.  Mountains and islands symbolize the most stable realities we know&#44; but will move when the Creator commands.  For the people of God this is not a message of fear but of awakening. The slow groans of the mantle and the sudden shocks of earthquakes are merciful warnings&#44; calling us to repentance and readiness.  Our preparation is not only physical&#44; it is spiritual. Our number one prep is Christ Jesus. Without him we are nothing. We are to live as those sealed by the Lamb&#44;confident that when the final shaking comes&#44; we belong to a kingdom that cannot be shaken. Folks here’s the reality&#44; when the sixth seal is finally opened and the great earthquake shakes heaven and earth&#44; only those firmly planted in Him will stand.  Please seek the Lord while He can still be found.   Love you all&#44;  Christopher Brock,"Sep 13, 2025 · 4:57 AM UTC",/chrismbrock/status/1966727890843652444#m,0,0,3,1

@keerthivahanan,🌊Atlantic Ocean Cooling Trend  Scientists are stunned by a sudden cooling of Atlantic waters off the Scotian Shelf&#44; reversing a decade-long warming trend. Here's what you need to know:  AMOC & Labrador Current: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and the Labrador Current are key players. Colder&#44; oxygen-rich water from the Labrador Current is moving south&#44; contrasting with warmer Gulf Stream waters that previously dominated.  - **Impact on Marine Ecosystems**: Cooler temperatures are affecting marine life. Lobster fisheries in Nova Scotia are seeing reduced landings due to immobilized crustaceans. The cold pool&#44; vital for shellfish like surf clams and sea scallops&#44; supports diverse ecosystems that could be disrupted.  - **Uncertainties & Research Needs**: Continuous monitoring is crucial. Scientists need 2-3 years of data to confirm if this is a long-term shift. Tracking marine heat waves and cold spell frequencies is essential. The impact of offshore wind farms on ocean circulation also requires further study.  Stay tuned for updates as researchers unravel the mysteries of this unexpected cooling trend #OceanCooling #AMOC #LabradorCurrent #MarineEcosystems #ClimateChange #Research #Oceanography,"Aug 22, 2024 · 5:54 AM UTC",/keerthivahanan/status/1826498148975739321#m,0,0,0,0
