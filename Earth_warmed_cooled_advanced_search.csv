@MarkCranfield_,Sustained climate forcing of less than 0.2 watts per m² warmed the Earth by around 7 degrees Celsius during the last deglaciation&#44; raising sea levels by around 400 feet.  For comparison&#44; climate/radiative/GHG forcing today is around FOUR watts per m². This represents the amount of forcing that's required to achieve planetary energy equilibrium&#44; ie. as much energy radiated as absorbed.  EEI of 1.4 W/m² is the  current actual/observed/realised-to-date net rate of energy (heat) absorption by the Earth (mostly the oceans) due to the equilibrium radiative forcing demanded by GHGs of 4 W/m².,"Sep 20, 2025 · 4:56 AM UTC",/MarkCranfield_/status/1969264424700477578#m,0,1,6,0

@ryankatzrosene,Akshually… we do have some evidence: - Earth has warmed ~1.4°C over 175 years and global mortality rates have declined significantly over this same period (mostly due to extraneous factors&#44; and partly due to temperature changes). - While it’s true humanity has not endured 2°C of warming (there’s no historical analogue); and there’s no doubt that there will be catastrophic consequences (we’ve already seen some from less warming)&#44; this is not of itself evidence that it would lead to “billions” of deaths. - All of the existing trends provide evidence that there will be MORE people on Earth in 2050 than present&#44; not billions *less*. For our global population to decline by 4 billion over the next 25 years the rate of death would have to start rising exponentially right away to overcome the rate of population growth.

@bright_idea_lab,🪨 Aswan Pink Granite & the Great Pyramid  These beautiful stones in my hand are pieces of Aswan pink granite. Geologically&#44; granite is an intrusive igneous rock formed deep in the Earth’s crust from slowly cooled magma&#44; giving it its interlocking crystals of feldspar&#44; quartz&#44; and mica.  What makes Aswan granite unique is its warm pink color&#44; caused by high concentrations of alkali feldspar. This distinctive stone was prized by the ancient Egyptians and quarried in southern Egypt for thousands of years.  Large blocks of Aswan pink granite were transported hundreds of miles north along the Nile to build some of the most enduring monuments in history. The inner chambers of the Great Pyramid at Giza were lined with Aswan granite&#44; chosen for both its durability and its resonance. The ancients understood that granite had a way of carrying and amplifying energy.  When we hold pieces of this same granite today&#44; we’re holding the very material that connects us to the pyramid builders and their extraordinary vision. It’s a direct link to the stones that have stood for over 4&#44;500 years&#44; continuing to anchor humanity’s fascination with both geology and mystery.

@Electroversenet,Antarctica has been cooling for 70 years.  We’re told Antarctica is “warming twice as fast as the globe.” The data say otherwise:  🔹 East Antarctica cooled steeply from 1986–2000&#44; with the McMurdo Dry Valleys plunging –0.7C (–1.3F) per decade.  🔹 West Antarctica warmed in the late 20th century&#44; but flipped: 1999–2018 saw cooling at –0.93C per decade&#44; with spring collapsing at –1.84C per decade.  🔹 The Peninsula’s hyped warming flatlined after the 1990s — a 2016 Nature paper confirmed no 21st-century warming.  🔹 Even the Southern Ocean has cooled since the 1990s.  CMIP6 models missed all of this. The establishment’s line of “runaway Antarctic warming” is a narrative&#44; not reality.

@1000Frolly,All the major thermometer datasets have been extensively manipulated.  The data before 1940 has generally been cooled and the data after 1940 generally warmed. In addition&#44; other alterations to the real data have been done in order to eliminate all natural variability&#44; and to create a fake climate record which more closely matches the curve of measured rise in CO2 levels.   These activist/'scientists' have been doing this for decades at GISS&#44; HadCRUT&#44; and NCDC. Even recent data such as MSU RSS has been doctored. They were so convinced that CO2 was a 'dangerous problem' that they failed as responsible scientists to report the facts.  Unfortunately&#44; these 'adjustments' to the real data have only been independently documented since 2008. Before that no-one really knows how great the changes made to the actual data were&#44; but it is certain that most of the real data has been radically changed for decades before 2008.

@ni3xmars,From 1900 to 2000&#44; Earth warmed by about 0.7°C&#44; CO₂ rose from 296 ppm to 369 ppm&#44; and sea levels climbed ~20 cm. These changes took 100 years.   From 2000 to 2025 alone&#44; temperatures rose another 0.7°C&#44; CO₂ jumped to 420+ ppm&#44; and sea levels rose 10 cm changes that once took a century now happened in 25 years.  At this pace&#44; by 2050 warming could exceed +2°C&#44; displacing over a billion people through floods and extreme heat.   By 2075&#44; sea levels may rise 50–70 cm&#44; drowning coastal cities. By 2100&#44; with 3–4°C warming and 1 meter sea-level rise&#44; large parts of Earth may no longer sustain human civilization.  The 20th century gave progress with slow risks. The 21st century is delivering collapse on fast-forward.

@RussCan91,Just taking a look at this on google earth. If this was artillery as claimed by multiple reports&#44; could the target be the water supply lines between the cooling towers?  These lines are critical pieces of infrastructure for the entire plant as they move the hot water to be cooled and then move the cool water into the plant.  These images are interesting because you see bluish smoke&#44; likely from fires from a strike. However&#44; the main cloud is more of a white which&#44; if say a pipe carrying hot water was hit&#44; could possibly be steam could it not?  You can verify this information as well&#44; but this may well have been the objective. To damage the cooling system to the plant. The plant is allegedly inactive now&#44; but still requires cooling. It may well have been the goal to damage this cooling with the hopes of not ruining the power plant in its entirety.,"Aug 12, 2025 · 5:39 PM UTC",/RussCan91/status/1955323269693034769#m,0,0,0,0

@Jesusarmy,History isn’t random. Even the Earth moves in numbers.  Look at the last great volcanic events that cooled the planet:  1257 – Samalas → 1+2+5+7 = 6 1452 – Kuwae → 1+4+5+2 = 3 1815 – Tambora → 1+8+1+5 = 6 1883 – Krakatoa → 1+8+8+3 = 2  The 6’s are the reset years — when the land roars and the loop forces a hard correction. The 3’s are the setup years — when the stage is prepared for the next collapse. The 2’s are the split years — division&#44; instability&#44; the reshuffling of power after the blast.  Even the gaps between these eruptions add up: 1257 → 1452 = 195 years → 6 1452 → 1815 = 363 years → 3 1815 → 1883 = 68 years → 5 (chaos&#44; freedom&#44; instability).  It’s a rhythm: 6 → 3 → 6 → 2&#44; with 5 as the wild card. A heartbeat you can measure in centuries.  If the pattern holds&#44; we’re heading into another turn of the wheel — and history says when the land Watchers roar in a 6 year&#44; the whole world feels it.  The loop doesn’t forget.

@ExploreCosmos_,A recent study suggests that a mysterious cosmic event from outside our solar system may have dramatically cooled Earth around two million years ago.   Researchers found tiny iron-rich particles in Antarctic ocean sediment that appear to be of interstellar origin&#44; possibly deposited by a nearby supernova.   This influx of material could have disturbed the solar system’s protective bubble&#44; the heliosphere&#44; allowing more cosmic rays to reach Earth. The increased radiation may have triggered cloud formation&#44; reduced solar heating&#44; and contributed to the onset of the current ice age cycle.  👉 share.google/lYLc7ACqYKOTFpb…,"Aug 6, 2025 · 6:59 PM UTC",/ExploreCosmos_/status/1953168967583023546#m,16,67,324,7

The passing of James Whale really upset me as he was an amazing man (the salt of earth) so someone defaming him the moment his death was announced on here broke my heart as August 4th was also the heavenly birthday of a late family member of mine.   I so appreciate your support more than you know. In the Uk we don’t celebrate or mock kind people that have passed.     Loyalty is important to me as i’m old school and won’t change.  Thanks again- this DM is just one of many. My followers are around 50 percent women and 50 percent men and the ladies often say not to take things the wrong way too when they thank me so Dm rather than post on my main page too.   Your support means the world to me though- please know this whether I hear&#44; read or see it.   Together we are an alliance and we can try to make the UK great again.

In a world increasingly reliant on air conditioning&#44; it's inspiring to see how ancient technology still offers solutions for a sustainable future.   No desert magic.

Oklo is a place in the Republic of Gabon where the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction occurred on the Earth 1&#44;8 billion years ago.  The proof is uranium deposits found in Oklo contained way less U-235 than is usual in nature. It means part of U-235 had fueled that reaction.

@MarioNawfal,🚨CLIMATE CLOCK IS TICKING: JUST 3 YEARS LEFT TO AVOID DISASTER  Earth has already warmed about 2.74°F  -  past the 2.7°F limit set by the Paris Agreement to avoid the worst climate impacts.  A new global report warns we’ve got less than 3 years before we use up the planet’s carbon budget and lock in even more extreme heat&#44; floods&#44; and chaos.  Only 25 countries have submitted updated climate plans. That covers just 1 out of every 5 tons of global emissions.  Only one plan  -  from the UK  -  actually lines up with the Paris target.   Everyone else? Blowing smoke.  The G20 puts out 80% of the world’s emissions&#44; but just 5 members have stepped up with new 2035 targets: the US&#44; UK&#44; Canada&#44; Brazil&#44; and Japan.

Born hot&#44; bombarded by asteroids&#44; it cooled and brewed life: single-celled pioneers emerged around 3.5 billion years ago. For nearly four billion of that&#44; microscopic life dominated. Then came the Cambrian Explosion (~541 M years ago)&#44; unleashing trilobites&#44; corals&#44; and bizarre early fauna. Dinosaurs ruled for ~165 million years before a cataclysm ended their reign. Mammals rose&#44; ice ages waxed and waned&#44; and four million years ago&#44; humans appeared—a blink in deep time.

@JosiahLuscher,"In case you don't know&#44; this is a very bad thing.  --  Explination: The earth is heated by the sun&#44; and is cooled by giving off&#44; mostly&#44; infrared radiation.  --  Of the light that hit's the planet some is reflected away and doesn't heat up this tiny ball of mud we live on.  However man made global warming has caused things like a loss of sea ice&#44; and uh&#44; other stuff (clouds?)&#44; and our planet has become less reflective.  So our planet absorbs more heat.  This extra energy we absorb will&#44; over time (months? years? decades?) Cause the planet to become hotter still. -- This is one of many ""Feedback loops"" that Scientists have been warning about for decades (~1960's I think).  This is just one of a few feedback loops&#44; but I think it's the biggest one (?).  --  This is a problem created over the last ~100 years; and we will see the results happen over the next few decades as things get worse and worse.  Until ""we"" aren't there to watch it happen any more.  --  DON'T BELIEVE IN GLOBAL WARMING&#44; save your faith for God.  Seek instead to understand what is happening.

@Murry_Rhodes,"It is but like the moon&#44; cooled&#44; like Mars cooled.. The Earth's awesome current state for life is not endless and has several calculable expiry dates.  The Sunny side&#44; the planet receives the equivalent of around 120°C degrees.  The Earth's night side is exposed to around -270°C.   The atmosphere's physics and chemistry helps redistribute the solar energy around the surface and Earth's Superthin Silicate Crystal Crust insulates us from being frizzled by the underlying magmas.  With this in mind&#44; our little blue ball is suspended between 120°C and -270°C with a midway or equilibrium point of around -150°C..  That we are spinning means thermal energy from the Sun gets distributed even more.  Our rate of spin determines the exposure on one side at any one time.  Venus&#44; effectively&#44; doesn't really spin&#44; it does but not enough so right now it is chemically and physically quite a nasty place that would change significantly if something gave it some spin.  If the Earth slowed it's spin at the current distance&#44; it could freeze over or it could turn into a planet like Venus.  The timing and thresholds make quite a difference.  Take a clear plastic bottle of water and put in direct sunlight for an hour.   Yup.. Think of the surface of the ocean and how much thermal energy it gains.  Luckily water evaporates and takes much of that heat up into the air as water vapour.  Otherwise&#44; the fearmongering UN statement of ""The Oceans are Boiling"" might be more true.  So slowing the planet's spin will increase evaporation and we know that water vapour contributes more than twice as much to the greenhouse effect than Co2 and is the real insulator that keeps our nights much toastier than the -270°C of the dark of space.  The Chemistry and physics of the atmosphere is not a forever thing.  All chemistry is in a state of constant entropy to seek its most stable state and at present&#44; we can track the approximate threshold of fairly constant atmospheric temperatures when the key systems are functioning normally.     The blue line in the graphical image shows this thermal threshold at around 22°C as well as moments in Earth's history when at least one of the main contributors to Earth's atmospheric thermal condition failed.  Be it reduced Solar activity&#44; increased cooling by Photosynthesis&#44; increased transformation of potential heat into cooler hydrocarbon bonds or wobbly wobbles from cosmic spinning cycles&#44; one thing that seems very apparent is that Co2 levels are constantly dropping and may be one of our greater concerns with regards to the longevity of life on this planet and that's if we don't get back up the normal temperature threshold of 22C .  If the money moguls had a brain geared toward longevity they might look for Co2 inteventions to bring what we can back into the carbon cycle of life and at the time maybe send out a technician to turn up the heat before we find ourselves in a feedback loop toward being an icicle Earth.

@LeonSimons8,I was asked to write a plain language summary. Does this help?:  The climate models used by the UN climate panel (IPCC) underestimate the changes in our climate observed by NASA satellites over the past 23 years.  Over the past 15 years (2010-2014)&#44; the Earth has warmed more than twice as fast as during the preceding 40 years (1970-2010).  NASA CERES satellites can be used to explain the underlying cause.  Due to the melting of ice and snow and a decrease in cloud cover&#44; the Earth reflects less sunlight back into space. This amplifies the (greenhouse gas-induced) warming of the Earth more than expected based on models.  Another reason for the discrepancy between observations and models is that the effect of particulate air pollution (aerosols) is likely underestimated. Air pollution also reflects sunlight and enhances cloud formation.  The fact that models are not aligned with observations is deeply concerning&#44; as it means we are underestimating the climate impact and the necessary measures.  Furthermore&#44; it is essential to secure and expand satellite observations in the future to ensure humanity does not become blind in an increasingly rapidly changing world.,"Jun 17, 2025 · 9:11 PM UTC",/LeonSimons8/status/1935082914523529718#m,29,263,532,18

@SkyTraveler87,🌿 Earth Signs – Feminine Current Snapshot  Your inner landscape feels like a hidden greenhouse: humid with patient potential&#44; scented by slow-growing herbs that release fragrance only when warmed by trust. You express the feminine current whenever you knead dough without rushing&#44; let fingertips pause on a textured surface&#44; or speak a single sentence that lands solidly and then rests untouched—yet the moment responsibilities pile up like stones&#44; you tighten the soil&#44; denying new roots the space to spread. The wisdom humming in hips&#44; spine&#44; and throat says your steadiness is already sacred; what needs nurturing is the willingness to loosen your schedule long enough for softness to bloom. Try lingering beside an open window until you hear two separate layers of birdsong&#44; or allow a friend’s compliment to sink through skin instead of skimming off the surface. Each small act of receptive stillness turns solidity into fertile humus&#44; and soon the quiet gardens you carry inside will feed every project you dare to plant.  #Taurus #virgo #Capricorn #feminineenergy,"May 18, 2025 · 1:53 PM UTC",/SkyTraveler87/status/1924100975880437942#m,0,0,2,0

@PillarsOfEden,"""The Earth Once Had Rings"" Fig. 2 – Earth Cooled From a Molten State (Its Ring System Formed)   – Isaac Newton Vail&#44; The Earth’s Annular System In the late 1800s&#44; Isaac Newton Vail proposed that Earth was once encircled by vast vapor rings&#44; similar to Saturn. These rings&#44; formed from a molten Earth&#44; gradually collapsed—culminating in the event known as Noah’s Flood. Vail’s Annular Theory aimed to unite geology&#44; Genesis&#44; and early atmospheric science.  He described:  A pre-Flood water canopy above the firmament  Successive collapses causing cataclysms  The firmament as a literal structure&#44; not myth  His ideas echo ancient records:  The Babylonian “waters above”  The Biblical firmament  Vedic celestial oceans  Though dismissed today&#44; his theory still raises enduring questions:  Why do cultures worldwide speak of a global flood? Did something once surround the Earth—and fall?  “The Earth was not always as it is now.” — Isaac Newton Vail  #HiddenHistory #Firmament #NoahsFlood #AnnularSystem #WatersAbove #BiblicalCosmology #PillarsOfEden","May 16, 2025 · 4:57 PM UTC",/PillarsOfEden/status/1923422683221352650#m,0,0,1,0

@AncientSkiesAS,How did the Moon come to be?  The Moon likely formed 4.5 billion years ago when a Mars-sized object&#44; called Theia&#44; smashed into Earth.

It’s Earth’s only natural satellite. The impact theory explains the Moon’s lack of iron. Its surface holds clues to Earth’s early history.

ACES will spend 30 months 🗓️ in space collecting data (through  microwave and optical links)&#44; controlled from Europe via CNES’s control centre in Toulouse 🇫🇷&#44; and the Columbus Control Centre near Munich 🇩🇪. ACES will provide scientists with new insights into the relationship between gravity and time&#44; helping to improve our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics.  ©️@esa @SpaceX @Space_Station @esaspaceflight,"Apr 22, 2025 · 1:47 PM UTC",/AirbusSpace/status/1914677377696776631#m,1,38,100,1

@MarcVegan,ChatGPT:  Climate change is happening unusually rapidly — especially compared to natural climate shifts in Earth’s history.  Here’s why scientists say it’s too rapid: 1.Speed of Warming: The Earth has warmed about 1.2°C (2.2°F) since the late 1800s&#44; but most of that warming has happened in just the last 50 years. That rate is roughly 10 to 100 times faster than past natural warming periods&#44; like those after ice ages. 2.Human Activity as the Driver: This acceleration correlates directly with increased greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels&#44; deforestation&#44; and industrial processes. CO₂ levels are higher now than at any point in at least 800&#44;000 years&#44; and they’re rising at an unprecedented pace. 3.Ecosystem and Infrastructure Stress: Many ecosystems and societies are struggling to adapt. Coral reefs&#44; polar species&#44; and crops dependent on specific climate patterns are being impacted faster than they can adjust or evolve. Similarly&#44; infrastructure built for 20th-century climate norms (like water systems or flood defenses) is becoming outdated. 4.Tipping Points and Irreversibility: Rapid warming raises the risk of crossing climate tipping points (like permafrost thaw or ice sheet collapse) that could trigger long-term&#44; irreversible changes.  So in short: yes&#44; the current rate of climate change is too fast for many natural and human systems to adapt effectively — and that’s a central concern of climate science and policy.,"Apr 20, 2025 · 9:04 AM UTC",/MarcVegan/status/1913881573222486494#m,0,0,0,0

@Talonabraxas,“The sun rises&#44; scattering its gold over the earth. Let your soul be warmed by its light.”  ― Rumi    Tonatiuh - Aztec Sun God   Day Quiahuitl (Rain&#44; known as Cauac in Maya) is governed by Tonatiuh&#44; the Sun God&#44; as its provider of tonalli (Shadow Soul) life energy. Quiahuitl is a day of relying on the unpredictable fortunes of fate.  According to Aztec beliefs&#44; the current era is the fifth age. The previous four ages were defined by their unique sun—each of which was ultimately destroyed. After the fourth sun was destroyed&#44; the Aztec gods gathered together to create the fifth and final sun: Tonatiuh. Like the suns that preceded him&#44; Tonatiuh was not immortal. Upon his death&#44; the world would descend into permanent darkness and the reign of men would come to an end.    Tōnatiuh’s name was derived from the Nahuatl words tona (“for there to be heat”) and yauh (“to go”). When used together&#44; these terms meant “it goes along emitting heat.” The word could be used both as the proper name of the god Tonatiuh and more casually in reference to the sun itself.  The Aztecs frequently referred to their gods by multiple names&#44; and Tonatiuh was no exception. Traditionally&#44; Aztec gods and individuals would go by the calendar name of their date of birth. Tonatiuh was created on naui olin&#44; or “Movement.” This name was part of a prophecy predicting that the current age would be destroyed by earthquakes.,"Apr 16, 2025 · 8:40 PM UTC",/Talonabraxas/status/1912607160539763182#m,0,0,0,0

@MockingBird0777,cnn.com/2025/04/02/science/d… Dark energy is created when a star traves through open space the super heated space is then quickly cooled by the darkness that would follow and I believe this is also what is creating the dark energy. As on Earth energy is never lost only transitioned. I believe this also happens in the vast void of space. This would account for the fact that dark energy is over 50 % of all know energy in the universe because. A star only occupies a section of space for a short time but. The path a star takes lasts for billions of years. Take our own sun . Since creation we estimate it has been around for 4.5 billion years and they estimate it has made 20 total revolutions in that time &#44; also known as a galactic year. That's a lot of potential dark energy production as the sun circles the entire Milky Way during a single galactic year and it takes 230 to 250 million years to complete one revolution. Now combine these facts and apply them to the rest of the stars in the known universe. Your result is a lot of potential dark energy well over 70 percent of all known energy in the universe to include the energy released by all of these stars every second. This theory also links space / time in a way that I believe there can really be no other explanation of what dark matter/energy is or how it comes to be. Not that I understand it any further than that but I have come to these conclusions on my own w/o the help of a super computer or any AI algorithm.

@OwenGregorian,Scientists ‘Unexpectedly’ Find The Declining Sea Ice Trend Since 1980 Has Radiatively Cooled The Earth | Kenneth Richard&#44; NoTricksZone  The alarmist narrative that says disappearing sea ice serves to enhance and worsen global warming may now be discarded.  For decades it has been assumed the sea ice concentration (SIC) reduction trend in the the Arctic over the first 30 years of the satellite era (1979-2007&#44; with a flat trend since then) would lead to a precipitous decline in reflective albedo. Consequently&#44; with more open water rather than brightly reflective ice&#44; the Arctic would perpetually warm even more than it already has.  But now&#44; according to analysis found in a new Science Advances study&#44; this assumption may no longer be valid.  The global top of atmosphere (TOA) radiative effect of SIC changes&#44; Δ𝑅&#44; is dependent not just on SIC trends in the Arctic&#44; but on SIC trends in Antarctica as well. The Southern Hemisphere’s SIC has been increasing throughout most of the satellite era&#44; especially from 1979 to 2015.  Globally&#44; then&#44; the Δ𝑅 of Antarctic SIC gains asymmetrically offsets the Δ𝑅 stemming from Arctic SIC reduction due to SIC-induced albedo feedback processes. Thus&#44; the modern era global SIC trends have served to “cool Earth.”  “[N]umerical simulations indicate that the bulk radiative effect of SIC reduction with certain spatial patterns (e.g.&#44; trends during 1980–2008) could even cool Earth due to the hemispheric asymmetry of SIC change.”  “[T]he negative trend during this period [1980-2008] is primarily induced by the SIC increase in the Antarctic regions. … [T]he radiative cooling induced by Antarctic SIC growth is greater than the radiative heating induced by Arctic SIC reduction.”  To reiterate&#44; the Δ𝑅 of declining global sea ice concentration (SIC) from 1980-2008 has led “to planetary cooling” due to the “radiative cooling induced by Antarctic SIC growth”. This is the opposite of what promulgators of disappearing-sea-ice alarmist narratives have been claiming for decades.  The authors of the paper accordingly describe the SIC-induced global cooling radiative effect stemming from declining global SIC as an “unexpected” development.  “Unexpectedly&#44; the trend of global Δ𝑅 [radiative effect of sea ice changes] is negative despite the statistically significant decrease of global SIC between 1980 and 2008&#44; implying that global SIC reduction leads to planetary cooling during this period.”  Read more:  notrickszone.com/2025/03/31/…,"Apr 1, 2025 · 11:09 AM UTC",/OwenGregorian/status/1907027413072249150#m,24,50,185,9

@geologyBits,In Geology ✔️ Did you know a single gemstone can shimmer in every hue of the rainbow&#44; and even beyond?  Meet tourmaline nature’s most vibrant masterpiece.  Picture this millions of years ago&#44; deep beneath the Earth’s crust&#44; molten rock cooled slowly in pockets of mineral-rich water.  As tectonic plates clashed and mountains rose&#44; tourmaline crystals began to form.  Born from chaos these gems captured the essence of their fiery birthplace&#44; trapping elements that would one day dazzle the world with color.  Geological Info Tourmaline is a boron silicate mineral with a complex crystal structure that allows it to host a variety of trace elements&#44; each tweaking its hue.  Iron lends deep greens and blues.  Manganese sparks pinks and reds.  Titanium can darken shades.  lithium-rich varieties glow in vivid neons&#44; like the coveted watermelon tourmaline&#44; with its green rind and pink core.  Its trigonal crystal system and piezoelectric properties (it generates an electric charge under pressure) make it a geological marvel.   Found in pegmatites coarse-grained igneous rocks&#44; tourmaline thrives in places like Brazil&#44; Afghanistan&#44; and California&#44; where conditions align just right.  Interesting Fact Tourmaline’s name comes from the Sinhalese word turamali&#44; meaning “stone of mixed colors.”  In the 18th century Dutch traders stumbled upon it in Sri Lanka&#44; mistaking it for other gems&#44; until its wild color range gave it away.

@jerryfuhrman22,"I don't argue the fact that the planet has warmed.  ""Last decade was Earth's hottest ever as CO2 levels reach an 800&#44;000-year high""  But neither I nor most people around the world are buying the CO@ excuse any longer.  Your first clue that there's a slight of hand going on is in the fact that no CO2 figures are included in the article.   Yet with the exclamation ""𝘊𝘖2 𝘭𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘭𝘴 𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘩 𝘢𝘯 800&#44;000-𝘺𝘦𝘢𝘳 𝘩𝘪𝘨𝘩"" (!!!!!) you'd think they would have.  No. You have to search out the WMO report to learn that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere rose from   0.0417%  to 0.0419%   Full Disclosure: CO2 is still a trace gas.
