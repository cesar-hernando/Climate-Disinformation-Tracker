@DallasDJackson,the worst World Hoax ever. Since the creation of the 4 billion planet Earth the climate has warmed and cooled countless time Humans have only been around for 200k years that's .005 % of our history. We’ve only produced any CO2 for 500 years. Historically CO2 was always higher,"Dec 5, 2023 · 8:46 PM UTC",/DallasDJackson/status/1732139515891068941#m,0,0,0,0

@Abdulkadir43501,Can a planet experience natural global warming without human interference? The earth has warmed and cooled many times before humans existed. But the changes have almost always been very slow&#44; and the exceptions of rapid change have greatly reduced the viability of the earth.,"Aug 29, 2023 · 7:08 PM UTC",/Abdulkadir43501/status/1696600758462923174#m,0,0,0,0
@PLVerratti,The much ignored (b/c it doesn't fit the Left's narrative) #MilankovitchTheory explains much of our #ClimateChange.  That & el nino most likely explain the current warmer temps&#44; nothing different than in ancient times; earth has ALWAYS warmed & cooled.  climate.nasa.gov/news/2948/m…,"Jul 24, 2023 · 4:06 PM UTC",/PLVerratti/status/1683508949503574016#m,0,1,3,0
@JDogg_Capital,Anyone that believes climate change is man-made has ZERO idea what they’re talking about. In the history of the earth&#44; climate has always warmed and cooled. We’re just on a spec in time… How high have sea levels risen since they sounded the alarm in the 1990’s? ZERO.,"Apr 13, 2023 · 11:37 AM UTC",/JDogg_Capital/status/1646477684279767042#m,1,0,3,0
@MiddlingtheMid,The earth has warmed and cooled since the day it was created. The ice there is left over from the last ice age&#44; it was always going to melt&#44; we’ve just accelerated that. If humans were alive when Pangea broke up he’d prob blame us for that too,"Jan 28, 2023 · 2:44 PM UTC",/MiddlingtheMid/status/1619345746947612673#m,0,0,0,0
