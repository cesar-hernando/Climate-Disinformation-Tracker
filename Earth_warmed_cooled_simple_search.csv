@cmlarl,cbc.ca/news/canada/no-lawn-m…: As soon as you mention the David Suzuki Foundation as a reference you can stop reading. Climate change isn't the issue.

@SteveNeale70,Well the oil and coal under the Arctic didn't get there by itself so at some point&#44; probably multiple points&#44; the poles have been lush green forests and teaming with life.  Then the earth cooled and then it warmed up. Sometimes quickly&#44; sometimes slowly depending on farty t-rex's,"Jul 14, 2025 · 5:01 PM UTC",/SteveNeale70/status/1944804488268669091#m,0,0,0,0
@meep_meep_speed,They tax the air in Canada. Toronto's mayor&#44; Olivia Chow was prepared to tax rain because the demoralization locomotive is still in full swing up here because climate change is all our fault too. Earth has warmed and cooled 6 times in the past 1200 years. We've been through warming and cooling cycles every 200 years or so. Our warming cycle plateaued in 1980. We are heading for a mini ice age. They'll have no choice to end the facade.

@Dirkuleese,Earth’s climate history spans 4.5B yrs: supercontinents like Pangea broke apart&#44; shifting oceans and CO2 levels (Taylor & Francis). Ice caps grew/shrank over millennia—Heinrich events&#44; Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles cooled/warmed the planet naturally. Glaciers aren’t ‘doomed&#44;’ they adapt! 500M yrs ago&#44; Rodinia’s breakup warmed the planet with CH4 release&#44; while Pangea’s formation cooled it with CO2 drawdown. Nature’s cycles at work! #LiberalAgenda #Cndpoli,"Jun 3, 2025 · 2:16 AM UTC",/Dirkuleese/status/1929723824825565502#m,0,0,0,0
@ToczekJozef,Abolish the astronomically costly EU Green Deal! Why? Its underlying theory of man-made global warming / climate change is’nt justified scientifically: it’s absurd & illogical. Why?

@JimOrnata,When you create an ice age event where is the off switch? You fail to see the long game and understand that humans have been on the stellar scene about a millisecond.

@cmlarl,So? In 4.5 billion years of existence Earth's climate has constantly warmed and cooled. Yet strangely we are still here. So much for climate change BS.

@PeterDClack,There's no evidence or suggestion carbon dioxide was responsible for these well known shifts in climate in the recent past. Clearly&#44; earth cooled & warmed rapidly in a random way & has done so throughout the 11&#44;700y Holocene interglacial. If CO2 had caused these changes&#44; wouldn't someone say so?,"Mar 28, 2025 · 11:16 PM UTC",/PeterDClack/status/1905760972742242631#m,31,628,"1,443",27
@GerardAMorrow,"Funny that&#44; the 1950 ice loss wasn't in the news. The Earth is warming. Has it always been at the same temperature? It's never warmed before? It's never cooled before. Do climate scientists believe that the world was always at the same temperature over millennia before the arrival of fossil fuels?  Let me tell you this WMO&#44; you're currently useful to the WEF&#44; not just useful&#44; precious. They need a world population frightened of the ""World"" to take it over&#44; and you guys are providing enthusiastic propaganda about the uselessness and danger humans are to the planet.   When the tumbrels start rolling they'll be doing it to the sound of the WMO's doom laden forecasts&#44; and the tens of thousands to millions of useless eaters put to death will I'm sure save the planet.  For the time being at least we can take note who is supporting this new tyranny and who isn't&#44; and as you should know&#44; but apparently don't&#44; ""what goes around&#44; comes around""&#44; and when the populace wake up to what you're intentions are for them they will extract a terrible revenge.","Mar 28, 2025 · 4:44 PM UTC",/GerardAMorrow/status/1905662287018352986#m,0,0,0,0

@Tomisadawg,If it’s not CO2 causing global warming&#44; what is it? We know that Earth's climate has warmed and cooled many times in the past. How did this happen. Greenhouse gases play no role in the warming of the planet. It is warmed because more solar radiation is absorbed because of decreasing cloud cover. The change is slight but there is no doubt that there is enough variation in cloud cover to effect the amount of sunlight reflected back to space by 1.2 C or more. See paper here... climate-veritas.com/?page_id… According to this research paper&#44; the answer is simple. For a variety of reasons&#44; the cloud cover of the earth changes regularly. As cloud cover decreases&#44; less sunlight is reflected into space and the earth warms a bit more rapidly. The reverse is true when cloud cover increases. One speculation as to what impacts the amount of cloud cover is based on changes in the earth’s magnetic field. Why it happens needs more research. But the fact that it happens is now irrefutable because cloud cover has been measured by NASA since 2001 via a satellite-based system called CERES.  CERES allows us to know how cloud cover is changing and how that relates to the amount of solar radiation that is striking the Earth surface. The correlation between decreasing cloud cover and the earth surface temp. is irrefutable.  This is all documented and well explained in a paper produced by Ned Nikolov Ph.D and Karl Zeller Ph.D.  climate-veritas.com/?page_id…,"Feb 1, 2025 · 4:44 AM UTC",/Tomisadawg/status/1885549772440010823#m,1,0,1,0
@Tomisadawg,"If its not CO2 causing global warming what is?    We know that earth's climate has warmed and cooled many times in the past.  How did this happen.    See paper here...   Green house gases play no role in the warming of the planet.  It is warmed because more solar radiation is absorbed because of decreasing cloud cover.    climate-veritas.com/?page_id…  According to recent research paper&#44; the answer is simple. For a variety of reasons&#44; the cloud cover of the earth changes regularly.  As cloud cover decreases&#44; there less sunlight is reflected back into space and the earth warms.  The reverse is true when cloud cover increases.  When considering this&#44; realize that the change in temp. we are currently worrying about (3C) is less than 4% of the total atmospheric temp - the moon surface temp difference is 89degC less than the earth with no atmosphere and the same amount of sunlight.  So the temp. change when viewed on the grand impersonal scale of the relationship between sun and earth is really not very dramatic.   The authors of a study paper have concluded that what happens is that global cloud cover is constantly changing.  This results in more or less solar heat reaching the surface of the earth and it has nothing at all to do with CO2.  It does however have a lot to do with water vapor.    In simple terms&#44; they conclude the following&#44;  ""Green house gases play no role in the warming of the planet.  It is warmed because more solar radiation is absorbed because of decreasing cloud cover.""
