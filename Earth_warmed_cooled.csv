@JimOrnata,When you create an ice age event where is the off switch? You fail to see the long game and understand that humans have been on the stellar scene about a millisecond. The earth has always warmed&#44; cooled and changed but you are to ignorant to see that.    telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/04…,"Apr 23, 2025 · 11:12 PM UTC",/JimOrnata/status/1915182058286248067#m,0,0,0,0
@GerardAMorrow,"Funny that&#44; the 1950 ice loss wasn't in the news. The Earth is warming. Has it always been at the same temperature? It's never warmed before? It's never cooled before. Do climate scientists believe that the world was always at the same temperature over millennia before the arrival of fossil fuels?  Let me tell you this WMO&#44; you're currently useful to the WEF&#44; not just useful&#44; precious. They need a world population frightened of the ""World"" to take it over&#44; and you guys are providing enthusiastic propaganda about the uselessness and danger humans are to the planet.   When the tumbrels start rolling they'll be doing it to the sound of the WMO's doom laden forecasts&#44; and the tens of thousands to millions of useless eaters put to death will I'm sure save the planet.  For the time being at least we can take note who is supporting this new tyranny and who isn't&#44; and as you should know&#44; but apparently don't&#44; ""what goes around&#44; comes around""&#44; and when the populace wake up to what you're intentions are for them they will extract a terrible revenge.","Mar 28, 2025 · 4:44 PM UTC",/GerardAMorrow/status/1905662287018352986#m,0,0,0,0
