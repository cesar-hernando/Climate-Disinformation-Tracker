@ElizabethFarah,👉🏼GREEN NEW SCAM :: Remember the NY Post's story on EV cars having a greater negative impact on the environment than gas vehicles? 👈🏼 🧵  Electric vehicles release more toxic particles into the atmosphere and are worse for the environment than their gas-powered counterparts&#44; according to a resurfaced study.  The study&#44; published by emissions data firm Emission Analytics&#44; was released in 2022 but has attracted a wave of attention this week after being cited in a Wall Street Journal op-ed Sunday.  It found that brakes and tires on EVs release 1&#44;850 times more particle pollution compared to modern tailpipes&#44; which have “efficient” exhaust filters&#44; bringing gas-powered vehicles’ emissions to new lows.  Today&#44; most vehicle-related pollution comes from tire wear. As heavy cars drive on light-duty tires — most often made with synthetic rubber made from crude oil and other fillers and additives — they deteriorate and release harmful chemicals into the air&#44; according to Emission Analytics  Because EVs are on average 30% heavier&#44; brakes and tires on the battery-powered cars wear out faster than on standard cars.,"Oct 17, 2024 · 2:18 PM UTC",/ElizabethFarah/status/1846918691708879321#m,1,0,0,0

@JrSeifried,Seeing Ford commercials on getting free chargers and installation. I wonder how much is the Government paying them to manufacture cars that aren’t selling?

@McLovinDemLosin,Mining for lithium and other essentials for batteries are thousands of times worse for the environment than any petrol engine.  The Left wants you have to have electric cars bcuz they can control them&#44; turn them off.  You can't control a gas engine.  #LeftLies,"Sep 5, 2024 · 7:38 PM UTC",/McLovinDemLosin/status/1831778895080661145#m,0,0,0,0
@lowfreqfilms,FACT: EVs Emit More Toxic Pollution Than Gas-Powered Vehicles:  ✅EVs are 30% heavier than Gas Cars = more brake & tire particles in the air.  ✅Energy to charge EVs comes from burning coal.  ✅Lithium&#44; Cobalt & Nickel mining causes environmental damage.  safety21.cmu.edu/2024/03/06/…,"Sep 5, 2024 · 5:57 AM UTC",/lowfreqfilms/status/1831572409398522112#m,0,0,0,1

@DarkKiwiYT,Electric cars are way&#44; way worse for the environment than oil & gas could ever be.

@ChronicRealityy,Electric cars aren’t good for the environment&#44; they are actually worse than your gas powered car.  The elites don’t care about the trees&#44; they want control.  With an electric car&#44; if you have an outstanding parking ticket&#44; your door will get locked and you’ll be driven to the police station.  The same people who say cow farts are a danger to society&#44; are the same people who take private jets to islands.  It was never about the environment.,"May 14, 2024 · 8:50 PM UTC",/ChronicRealityy/status/1790484887352266971#m,0,3,8,0
@WomanDefiner,I think the argument around electric cars is fine as long as its honest. They aren't eco friendly. They have the potential to be but right now they are far worse for the environment than gas cars and its not even arguable.,"May 11, 2024 · 5:22 PM UTC",/WomanDefiner/status/1789345458118172841#m,16,8,77,1
